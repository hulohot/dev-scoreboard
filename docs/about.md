## Project Description

This project is a scoreboard that is used to keep track of the number of commits and pull requests that a developer has made. The scoreboard is a Raspberry Pi that is connected to a servo motor. The servo motor is connected to a candy dispenser. When a developer makes a commit or pull request, the servo motor is activated and candy is dispensed. The scoreboard is connected to a web application that is used to keep track of the number of commits and pull requests that a developer has made. The web application is also used to add and remove developers from the scoreboard.
