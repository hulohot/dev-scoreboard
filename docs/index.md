# Welcome to the Wearable & Ubiquitous Computing Final Project

This is the documentation for our Wearable & Ubiquitous Computing final project, which aims to help developers stay accountable to themselves and feel rewarded. We designed a system that helps developers track their progress, monitor their emotions, and receive candy rewards for their achievements.

Our project consists of several features, including a candy dispenser that gives out candy when the developer pushes a commit or makes a pull request, a dedicated monitor that displays the developer's number of commits, pull requests, and lines of code throughout the day, and a Kinect camera that monitors the developer's emotions. The system also includes a dashboard that displays the gathered information and key insights, as well as a leaderboard that shows how the developer's fellow developers are doing throughout the day.

In this documentation, we will describe the design and implementation of our system in detail, including the hardware and software components, testing strategies, technical challenges, and the tools and technologies used. We will also provide a user manual, technical manual, release notes, and maintenance guide for those interested in replicating or further developing our system.

We hope you find our project interesting and informative. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or feedback.
