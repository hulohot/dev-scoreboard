# Project Overview

This is a final project for the class CSCE 5013 - Wearable & Ubiquitous Computing. It is used for tracking and assisting a developer throughout their daily workflow.

## Project Description

Our project is a system that helps developers stay accountable to themselves and feel rewarded. We designed the system to provide developers with visual and tangible feedback for their achievements, which we hope will help them stay motivated and engaged in their work.

The system includes several features, including a candy dispenser that gives out candy when the developer pushes a commit or makes a pull request, a dedicated monitor that displays the developer's number of commits, pull requests, and lines of code throughout the day, and a Kinect camera that monitors the developer's emotions. The system also includes a dashboard that displays the gathered information and key insights, as well as a leaderboard that shows how the developer's fellow developers are doing throughout the day.

## Target Users

Our system is designed for developers who work on projects alone or in a team. We believe our system can be particularly useful for those who work remotely or in distributed teams, as it provides a way for them to feel connected and engaged in their work.

## Project Goals

Our primary goal is to create a system that helps developers stay accountable to themselves and feel rewarded for their achievements. We hope our system will motivate developers to push themselves and stay engaged in their work, and that it will help foster a positive and supportive work culture.
